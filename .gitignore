At this point in the digital age, we all know how to make a Facebook profile (heck, you’ve probably been on Facebook for so long, you don’t even remember making your profile anymore). However, many of us are less familiar with the process of creating Facebook Pages, or have never been faced with the need to make one. If you’re a nonprofit with some awesome social impact goals, then you probably do have the need for a Facebook Page. If you already have a profile with followers or information that’s tied to your organization, then luckily you don’t have to start from scratch. Check out our step-by-step guide below on how to convert a Facebook profile into a Page.

Why would I need to convert a Facebook profile into a Page?
Well, first of all, it’s breaking the Facebook terms of service to use a profile to represent anything other than yourself (i.e., your nonprofit). If you use a personal profile to represent a business and don’t convert it into a Facebook Page instead, you could permanently lose access to your account.
There are also a ton of perks to creating a Facebook Page for your organization: If you convert your Facebook profile into a Page, you’ll have access to Facebook Insights (yay for useful data!), have the chance to share admin access with your colleagues, and be able to create Facebook ads. Even if you’re comfortable with the layout of your profile, a Facebook Page is definitely the better tool for your organization.
